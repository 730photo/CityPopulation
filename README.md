# Population

This is the 6th project of the #JavaScript30. I made an AJAX type head where I have a list of cities and states and when I type someting in it like the word "new", it will show me every city and state that matches what i've typed in along with the corresponding population.

Things I learned:
<ul>
  <li>The fetch method</li>
  <li></li>
  </ul>

Goals:
<ul>
  <li>Make mobile responsive</li>
</ul>
